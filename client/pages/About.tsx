    As a native Australasian, I grew up exploring the rugged, rocky outback of Australia before moving to the lush, awe-inspiring mountains of New Zealand. My love for the outdoors has shaped who I am and inspired me to create We Hikeâ€”an app designed to make hiking accessible to everyone.

    I&apos;m passionate about promoting safety, preparedness, and knowledge for adventurers exploring New Zealand&apos;s wild and beautiful wilderness. Whether you&apos;re a seasoned trekker or just starting out, We Hike is here to help you make the most of your journey.
